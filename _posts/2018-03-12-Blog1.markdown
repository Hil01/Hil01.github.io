THE BLACK WOLF

It comes with a promise, that never arrives, <br/>
While it drags you away, with seductive lies! <br/>
It then starts to alter, and rewire your brain, <br/>
And all it will bring you is sorrow and shame! <br/>
<br/>
Once is too many, yet a thousand's not enough, <br/>
But trying to stop, is incredibly tough! <br/>
So you make up excuses, you try to defend, <br/>
But then to this nightmare, you wake up again! <br/>
<br/>
It brings nothing good, but takes your best, <br/>
It steals your time, then leaves you depressed! <br/>
By drinking the nectar, of this false god, <br/>
Your life will dry out, like grey dying sod! <br/>
<br/>
But here is the answer, to all forms of dope, <br/>
Reboot and reset, and know there is hope! <br/>
You must starve the black wolf, until it is dead, <br/>
And nourish the white one, to live free instead!<br/>
